# Test Data for Baseline Benchmarks

This directory contains a heterogeneous collection of files used for establishing encoding/decoding performance baselines.

## Contents
- Text files (.txt, .sh)
- Images (.png)
- Audio/Video (.mp3, .mp4)
- PDF documents (.pdf)

## Usage
These files are used by `dna_storage/benchmarks/run_baseline.py` to verify correctness and measure performance. They should **NOT** be modified manually. The benchmark suite treats them as read-only reference data.
